Links to Addition Libaries NEEDED from Adafruit! 

1. Adafruit_GPS -> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_GPS
2. Adafruit_Sensor -> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor

  * I2C must modify "Wire" to "Wire1" in the cpp file use SCL1 and SDA1 (with pullup resistor) for Arduino Due  
3. Adafruit_L3GD20 (Triple Axis Gyroscope) -> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_L3GD20


4. Adafruit_LSM303 (Accelerometer + Magnetometer) -> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LSM303DLHC
 ****  In above file LSM303.cpp file, change ALL occurrences of Wire to Wire1 except for the initial include of <Wire.h>
  This is needed for the Magnetometer to work. ****

5. due_can library https://github.com/atlas0fd00m/CanCat/blob/master/ext_libs/due_can/due_can.h
